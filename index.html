			<h2>Who is I?</h2>
			<p>
				I am an independant <span id="display"></span> Year old YouTube content creator and fast food worker with too much freetime that
				has partnered with multiple studios. I got my start in 2012 with the creation of my first Channel, at
				the time... named PokeKid206, yeah terrible name right? Well that channel got me started inside the
				YouTube atmosphere, though about 2 years later it would be pretty well abandoned as I made the complete
				change over to my current Channel, originally called Ender GFX but has evolved into my current
				personality and name, Sakura Sedaia.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Sometime in October 2018 I started in a small Machinima "Studio" called Alpha Studios, where I would
				begin making a name for myself as a 3D Minecraft Animator and Render artist.
